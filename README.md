Publishes Asterisk call information to Slack

Edit and enter your Astrisk server parameters and Slack API token.

Most work done by Olivier H. Beauchesne http://olihb.com/2010/08/08/incoming-call-popup-under-ubuntu-and-asterisk/ 
for subscribing to Astrisk and https://github.com/loisaidasam/pyslack for wrapping the Slack API.

Furth filtering and enhancement of the data from Asterisk before pushing to Slack is up to you.
